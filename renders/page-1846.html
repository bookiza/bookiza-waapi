He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.</p><p>â€”Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.</p><p>And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.</p></div> </div>
